# Personal React Typescript Boilerplate

This is a go-to boilerplate that I usually use to create React TypeScript projects.

## Dependencies

If some of the dependencies do not meet your needs, you may add them directly.

- React Hook Form - Handling forms and input validation
- React Query - Managing API calls and data from APIs
- Axios - Performing http calls
- Zustand - Global state management
- React Router Dom - Navigation
